# life-expectancy-prediction-model
## Introduction:
Life expectancy varies greatly by country, impacted by demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors. Analyzing the data on life expectancy and relevant factors has significant implications for health outcomes, programs, and policies. Using a data set from the World Health Organization that contains life expectancy and relevant factors of 192 countries from 2000 to 2015, we aim to investigate the causal relationship between the top 6 most correlated features: schooling, income, BMI, alcohol consumption, GDP, national healthcare expenditure, and life expectancy. We plan to use a single-parameter linear regression model for schooling, a single-parameter linear regression model for income, a multi-parameter linear regression model for both schooling and income, and finally a multi-parameter linear regression model for the top 6 most correlated features to life expectancy to predict life expectancy for people using the data from 2000 to 2015. The chosen predictors are directly relevant to life expectancy, and our research aims to use relevant data to predict life expectancy accurately.
